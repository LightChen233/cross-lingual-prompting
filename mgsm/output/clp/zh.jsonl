What is the distance that Sophia can travel on one tank of gas? \n\nTo calculate this, we need to use a formula that takes into account the miles per gallon (MPG) of Sophia's car. We can calculate MPG by dividing the number of miles traveled by the gallons of gas used. \n\nSo, let's say Sophia's car gets an average of 25 MPG (miles per gallon).

If the raccoon took 20 fries, then there were 30 fries left before the raccoon appeared. \n\nBefore the pigeons ate nine fries, there must have been 12 fries left. Therefore, there were three times as many fries before the pigeons appeared, or 36 fries. \n\nIf the seagull ate half of Dave’s fries, then there were 28 fries left.

Translate the problem into English, making sure you understand the key quantities involved: Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations and 200 pink lilies, which is five times as many as white carnations.\n\n2. Write down the quantities involved: Let r = the number of red roses and c = the number of white carnations.\n\n3. Use the information provided to set up a system of equations: r = 4c (since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations) and 200 = 5c (since Sandra ordered 200 pink lilies, which is five times as many as white carnations).

What is the percentage difference between the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and the probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers?\"\n\nNow, let's break down the question:\n\n1. Jerry is rolling a six-sided die\n- We know that there are six possible outcomes when rolling a die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.\n\n2. What is the percentage difference between the probability of rolling a number greater than 3...\n- We need to find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, which means rolling a 4, 5, or 6.\n- To calculate the probability, we need to divide the number of desired outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, there are three desired outcomes (4, 5, or 6) and six possible outcomes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6). Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 or 1/2.\n\n3. ...and the probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers?\n- We need to find the probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers. This means rolling either 2 and 4, 4 and 6, or 6 and 2.\n- To calculate the probability, we need to divide the number of desired outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, there are three desired outcomes (2 and 4, 4 and 6, or 6 and 2) and 36 possible outcomes (6 possible outcomes for the first roll multiplied by 6 possible outcomes for the second roll). Therefore, the probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers is 3/36 or 1/12.\n\nNow we need to calculate the percentage difference between these two probabilities. To do this, we subtract the probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, divide that difference by the probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers, and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage. \n\nSo:\n\n- Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 = 1/2\n- Probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers = 1/12\n- Percentage difference = ((1/2 - 1/12) / (1/12)) * 100 = 316.67%\n\nTherefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 316.67% more likely than the probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers."}, {"role": "user", "content": "After understanding, you should act as an expert in arithmetic reasoning in English.\nLet's resolve the task you understand above step-by-step!\nFinally, you should format your answer as 'Answer: [num]'."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: 233.33\n\nTo solve this question, we need to find the percentage difference between the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and the probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers.\n\nThe probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 1/2 (as there are three desired outcomes out of six possible outcomes). \n\nThe probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers is 1/12. There are three possible outcomes (2 and 4, 4 and 6, or 6 and 2), and there are 36 possible combinations of two rolls of a six-sided die. \n\nTo find the percentage difference between these two probabilities, we can use the following formula:\n\n(Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 - Probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers) / Probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers * 100%\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n(1/2 - 1/12) / (1/12) * 100% = 0.4167 / 0.0833 * 100% = 4 * 100% = 400%\n\nThus, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 400% more likely than the probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers. \n\nHowever, we need to find the percentage difference rather than the percentage increase, so we subtract 100 from the result to get:\n\n400% - 100% = 300%\n\nTherefore, the percentage difference is 300%, or 3 times more likely.

So the question is, how many shells did Kelly collect on Tuesday? \n\nWe can solve it by using a bit of math. If we let x be the number of shells Kelly collected on Monday, then on Tuesday she collected 2x shells. \n\nSo, we know that on Monday, Kelly collected x + 5 shells. And on Tuesday she collected 2x shells. \n\nIf we add those two numbers together, we get the total number of shells Kelly collected over both days: \n\nx + 5 + 2x = 3x + 5 \n\nBut we also know that the total number of shells Kelly collected over both days is the same as the number of shells Robert collected on Monday and Tuesday combined: \n\n3x + 5 = 20 + ??? \n\nSo, we need to solve for x in order to find out how many shells Kelly collected on Tuesday. \n\n3x + 5 = 20 + ??? \n\n3x + 5 - 20 = ??? \n\n3x - 15 = ??? \n\n3(x - 5) = ??? \n\nSo, we know that x - 5 is equal to the number of shells Robert collected on Tuesday. \n\nAnd we also know that Kelly collected twice as many shells on Tuesday as she did on Monday. \n\nSo, if Kelly collected x shells on Monday, and 2x shells on Tuesday, then the total number of shells she collected over both days is: \n\nx + 2x = 3x \n\nBut we also know that 3x is equal to the number of shells Robert collected over both days: \n\n3x = 20 + x - 5 \n\n2x = 15 \n\nx = 7.5 \n\nSo, Kelly collected 7.5 + 5 = 12.5 shells on Monday. \n\nAnd on Tuesday, she collected 2 times that number, which is: \n\n2 * 12.5 = 25 \n\nTherefore, Kelly collected 25 shells on Tuesday."}, {"role": "user", "content": "After understanding, you should act as an expert in arithmetic reasoning in English.\nLet's resolve the task you understand above step-by-step!\nFinally, you should format your answer as 'Answer: [num]'."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure, I can help with that! \n\nTo solve the problem, we need to use arithmetic reasoning. \n\nFirst, we know that on Monday, Kelly collected 5 more shells than Robert did, and Robert collected 20 shells. So Kelly collected: \n\n20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday \n\nNext, we know that on Tuesday, Kelly collected twice as many shells as she did on Monday. So if she collected x shells on Monday, she collected 2x shells on Tuesday. \n\nWe don't know the exact value of x, but we can use the fact that Kelly collected a total of 25 + 2x shells over both days. \n\nWe also know that the total number of shells Kelly collected is equal to the total number of shells Robert collected on Monday and Tuesday combined. \n\nSo, we can set up an equation: \n\n25 + 2x = 20 + x + ??? \n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\n2x - x = 20 - 25 \n\nx = -5 \n\nThis doesn't make sense, since we can't have a negative number of shells. So we made a mistake somewhere. \n\nLet's go back and check our work. \n\nWe know that Kelly collected 5 more shells than Robert on Monday, so: \n\nKelly = Robert + 5 \n\nKelly + Robert = 25 + 20 = 45 \n\nSubstituting, we get: \n\n(Robert + 5) + Robert = 45 \n\n2Robert + 5 = 45 \n\n2Robert = 40 \n\nRobert = 20 \n\nSo Robert collected 20 shells on Monday, and Kelly collected 25 shells on Monday. \n\nOn Tuesday, Kelly collected twice as many shells as she did on Monday, so: \n\nKelly = 2 * 25 = 50 \n\nTherefore, Kelly collected 50 shells on Tuesday. \n\nAnswer: 50"}], "origin": {"text": "凯莉和罗伯特喜欢去海滩收集贝壳。周一，凯莉比罗伯特多收集了 5 枚贝壳，罗伯特收集了 20 枚贝壳。周二，凯莉收集的贝壳比她周一收集的多出 2 倍。凯莉周二收集了多少贝壳？", "answer": "50"}}

To solve the problem, we need to find out how fast Dana can run and walk. We know that her running speed is four times faster than her walking speed. Let's say her walking speed is \"x\" miles per hour. Then, her running speed would be 4x miles per hour.\n\n2. We also know that Dana can jump at a speed that is half as fast as her running speed. So, her jumping speed is (1/2) * (4x) = 2x miles per hour.\n\n3. Now, we need to use the information given in the problem to find out how many miles Dana can cover in six hours. We know that she runs for one-third of the time, which is 6/3 = 2 hours. And she walks for two-thirds of the time, which is 6/3 * 2 = 4 hours.\n\n4. Let's first calculate how far Dana can run in 2 hours. Her running speed is 4x miles per hour, so in 2 hours, she can cover 2 * 4x = 8x miles.\n\n5.

But we still don't know what \"x\" is. We know that Dana's jumping speed is 3 miles per hour. We found out earlier that her jumping speed is 2x miles per hour.

Then, her running speed would be 4x miles per hour.\n\n2. We also know that Dana can jump at a speed that is half as fast as her running speed. So, her jumping speed is (1/2) * (4x) = 2x miles per hour.\n\n3. Dana runs for one-third of the time, which is 6/3 = 2 hours. And she walks for two-thirds of the time, which is 6/3 * 2 = 4 hours.\n\n4. Let's first calculate how far Dana can run in 2 hours. Her running speed is 4x miles per hour, so in 2 hours, she can cover 2 * 4x = 8x miles.\n\n5. Now, let's calculate how far Dana can walk in 4 hours.

In this case, the story involves a dragon named Perg who is sitting atop a mountain called Farbo. Perg is spitting fire at anything within 1000 feet of him. The protagonist of the story is a person named Polly who has a special weapon called a golden javelin that can kill the dragon.\n\nStep 2: Determine what the problem is. The problem in this story is that Polly needs to hit the dragon with the golden javelin, but she can only throw it a certain distance. The dragon is currently spitting fire at anything within 1000 feet, so Polly needs to figure out how far away she needs to be in order to avoid the dragon's flames and still be able to hit it with the javelin.\n\nStep 3: Determine what information is provided in the story. We know that Polly can throw the golden javelin a maximum distance of 400 feet, which is within the range of the dragon's flames. However, when she has a sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than usual.\n\nStep 4: Identify what language the question is in and translate it if necessary. The question is in Spanish, so if you do not speak Spanish, you will need to translate it. The question asks \"At what distance outside the range of the dragon's flames could Polly stand in order to hit the dragon with the golden javelin while having the gemstone?\"\n\nStep 5: Answer the question. To answer the question, we need to determine the maximum distance Polly can throw the javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone. If her usual maximum distance is 400 feet and she can throw it three times farther with the gemstone, she can throw it a maximum distance of 1200 feet. This means she can stand at a distance of 1000 feet + 1200 feet = 2200 feet from the dragon and still be able to hit it with the javelin, because 2200 feet is farther than the range of the dragon's flames.

Uriah will remove 30 comic books, and the question asks how many toys he must also remove to hit 15 pounds lighter overall.\n\nTo solve this, we need to perform some calculations. We start with the weight lost from the removed 30 comic books. If comic books weigh 1/4 pound each, then removing 30 results in a reduced weight of (`1/4 x 30 = 7.5`) 7.5 pounds.\n\nNow, we need to figure out how many more items we need to remove. We know the target amount, in this case `15`, whereas we removed `7.5` already, so the remaining amount we must remove equals \"`15 - 7.5`\", giving a remaining `7.5`.\n\nSince each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we just divide the remaining `7.5` lbs. by the weight of an individual toy, giving \"`7.5 / 0.5`\", so he has to remove another '`15`'.\n\nTherefore the final answer would be:   `15` additional toys must be removed from the bag to hit 15 pounds lighter overall."}, {"role": "user", "content": "After understanding, you should act as an expert in arithmetic reasoning in English.\nLet's resolve the task you understand above step-by-step!\nFinally, you should format your answer as 'Answer: [num]'."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many toys Uriah needs to remove from his bag to reach the target weight of 15 pounds lighter. \n\nFirst, we need to calculate the weight of the comic books that Uriah removes from his bag.

This means that the hospital makes a profit of $50 per hour for each patient visit ($200 - $150 = $50).\n\nTo determine the profit for 500 patient visits per day, we need to calculate the total number of hours worked by the doctors. Multiplying 500 visits by 24 minutes each, and converting to hours, we get:\n\n500 visits x (24 minutes / 60 minutes) = 200 hours\n\nSo the doctors work for 200 hours per day.

The hospital charges $200 per hour to each patient, and as we saw earlier, the average duration of a patient visit is 24 minutes, or 0.4 hours.

If she received $8 in change, how much money, in dollars, did she give to the cashier?\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to combine our understanding of basic math operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) with our ability to read and understand the problem in both English and Spanish. Here's how we can break it down:\n\n- First, we need to identify the key pieces of information in the problem. We know that the cost of an adult ticket is $12 and the cost of a child ticket is $10. We also know that Brittany's mom bought one of each, and that she received $8 in change.\n- Next, we need to use that information to set up an equation that will help us solve for the missing piece (in this case, the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier). We can start by using x to represent the amount of money she gave:\n   - 12 + 10 = x\n   - This equation says that the total cost of one adult ticket plus one child ticket is equal to the amount of money Brittany's mom gave to the cashier.\n- Finally, we can use some simple algebra to solve for x:\n   - 12 + 10 = x\n   - 22 = x\n   - Therefore, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $22. \n\nEn español:\n\nPara resolver este problema, necesitamos combinar nuestra comprensión de las operaciones matemáticas básicas (suma, resta, multiplicación y división) con nuestra habilidad para leer y entender el problema tanto en inglés como en español.

If their profit was $25, we need to figure out how much they spent on lemons.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to use some basic math. We know that their profit was $25, so we can set up an equation:\n\nProfit = Revenue - Cost\n\nWe know that their revenue comes from selling cups of lemonade, so we can calculate that as:\n\nRevenue = Price per cup x Number of cups sold\n\nWe know that they sell each cup for $0.50 and get 20 cups per gallon, so we can calculate the revenue per gallon as:\n\nRevenue per gallon = $0.50 x 20 cups = $10\n\nNow we need to figure out their cost per gallon. We know that they spend $3 on lemons and $2 on sugar for each gallon, so their total cost per gallon is:\n\nCost per gallon = $3 + $2 = $5\n\nNow we can plug these values into our equation:\n\n$25 = $10 - $5\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$25 = $5\n\nThis doesn't make sense, so we must have made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back and check our calculations.\n\nAh, we made a mistake in calculating the revenue per gallon. We multiplied the price per cup by the number of cups, but we should have multiplied by the number of gallons.

Firstly, we need to calculate how many small rodents are in total, and then we can find out how many rats are in each cage.\n\nTo do this, we can use the following formula:\n\nTotal number of small rodents = (number of rat cages * number of rats per cage) + (number of hamster cages * number of hamsters per cage) + (number of rabbits in the pen)\n\nPlugging in the values we have:\n\nTotal number of small rodents = (3 * x) + (10 * y) + 1\n(where x is the number of rats in each cage and y is the number of hamsters in each cage)\n\nWe also know that:\n\n- Each rat receives 6 pieces of straw.\n- Each hamster receives 5 pieces of straw.\n- The rabbits in the pen receive 20 pieces of straw.\n\nSo we can use this information to set up another equation:\n\nTotal number of straw = (number of rat cages * x * 6) + (number of hamster cages * y * 5) + (number of rabbits in the pen * 20)\n\nPlugging in the values we have:\n\n160 = (3 * x * 6) + (10 * y * 5) + (1 * 20)\n\nSimplifying:\n\n160 = 18x + 50y + 20\n\nNow we can use this equation to solve for x, the number of rats in each cage:\n\n18x = 160 - 50y - 20\n18x = 140 - 50y\nx = (140 - 50y) / 18\n\nSince we know there are an equal number of rats in each cage, we can equate x to the total number of rats divided by 3:\n\nx = total number of rats / 3\n\nNow we have two equations that we can solve simultaneously to find the number of rats in each cage:\n\nx = (140 - 50y) / 18\nx = total number of rats / 3\n\nEquating these equations, we get:\n\ntotal number of rats / 3 = (140 - 50y) / 18\n\nSimplifying:\n\n6 * total number of rats = 3 * (140 - 50y)\n2 * total number of rats = 140 - 50y\n2 * total number of rats + 50y = 140\ny = (140 - 2 * total number of rats) / 50\n\nWe know that the number of rats and hamsters must be integers, so we can test different values of total number of rats until we get an integer value of y. If we set total number of rats to 12, we get:\n\ny = (140 - 2 * 12) / 50\ny = 1\n\nSo there is 1 hamster in each cage, and therefore:\n\nx = (140 - 50 * 1) / 18\nx = 4\n\nTherefore, there are 4 rats in each cage."}, {"role": "user", "content": "After understanding, you should act as an expert in arithmetic reasoning in English.\nLet's resolve the task you understand above step-by-step!\nFinally, you should format your answer as 'Answer: [num]'."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure, let's solve the problem!\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of small rodents in the store.

So, in 4 minutes, each pool will have lost 4 x 4 = 16 gallons of water.\n\nNext, we know that four minutes ago, both pools had the same amount of water. Therefore, the amount of water lost in each pool is the same, and the ratio of the water in the large pool to the small pool is still 1:1.\n\nNow, we are told that the large pool has four times the amount of water as the small pool. Since the ratio of the water in the two pools is still 1:1, this means that the large pool has 4/5 of the total water, and the small pool has 1/5 of the total water.\n\nTherefore, the current amount of water in the small pool is (1/5) x (total water - 16 gallons).

Let's start by setting up equations for the number of snails and fish in each aquarium. Let's call the number of snails in the first aquarium \"s1\" and the number of snails in the second aquarium \"s2\". Similarly, let's call the number of fish in each aquarium \"f\". \n\n2. We know that s2 - s1 = 2f, since the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. \n\n3. We also know that the two aquariums have the same number of fish, so f is the same in both equations. \n\n4. Now we can set up another equation using the total number of snails in both aquariums: s1 + s2 = 36 (since there are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 in the other). \n\n5. We can use substitution to solve for f. From the first equation, we know that s2 - s1 = 2f, so we can rearrange to get f = (s2 - s1)/2. We can substitute this into the second equation to get s1 + s2 = 36, which becomes s1 + (s1 + 2f) = 36. \n\n6. Simplifying this equation, we get 2s1 + 2f = 36, or s1 + f = 18. \n\n7. Now we can substitute our expression for f into this equation: s1 + (s2 - s1)/2 = 18. Simplifying, we get s2 = 2(18 - s1) + s1 = 36 - s1. \n\n8. We can substitute this expression for s2 into our first equation: (36 - s1) - s1 = 2f, or 36 - 2s1 = 2f. \n\n9. Finally, we can solve for f: f = (36 - 2s1)/2 = 18 - s1. \n\n10. We can use this expression for f to solve for s1: s1 + (18 - s1) = 18, so s1 = 9. \n\n11. Now we can use our expressions for s1 and f to find s2: s2 = 36 - s1 = 27. \n\nAnswer: There are 9 fish in each aquarium."}], "origin": {"text": "Hay 4 caracoles en un acuario y 32 caracoles en otro acuario.

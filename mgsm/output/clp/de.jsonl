We know that she sold one-third of her vacuums at the green house, so we can use this fraction to calculate the number of vacuums she sold there: \n\n1/3 x Total number of vacuums = Number of vacuums sold at the green house. \n\nSimilarly, she sold two more vacuums at the red house.

Since she started with a certain number of vacuums and sold some, we can calculate this difference and find the number of vacuum cleaners remaining. Then, we take half of the remaining vacuums and sold them at the orange house. Finally, we need to add up the number of vacuums sold at the green and red houses plus the number sold at the orange house. \n\nUsing algebraic notations, we can set up an equation: \n\n1/3x + 2 + 1/2( x - 1/3x - 2 ) = x - 5 \n\nwhere x is the total number of vacuums Melanie started with. \n\nThen we can solve the equation to find x.\n\nAs language expert, I can confidently say that understanding the problem in English if you can read it is a good start.

After 20 years, she is entitled to receive 5% of the value of the annual pension per year.

First, calculate the value of her annual pension after 20 years of service. This would be:\n\nAnnual pension value after 20 years = $50,000 * 5% * 20 years = $50,000 * 0.05 * 20 = $50,000\n\nSo, after 20 years of service, Marcy's annual pension value would be $50,000.\n\n2. Next, we need to calculate the value of her annual pension for the remaining 10 years of service. This would be:\n\nAnnual pension value for the remaining 10 years = $50,000/year * 10 years = $500,000\n\nSo, for the remaining 10 years of service, Marcy's annual pension value would be $500,000.\n\n3. Finally, we add the two values to get Marcy's total annual pension after 30 years of service:\n\nTotal annual pension after 30 years of service = Annual pension value after 20 years + Annual pension value for the remaining 10 years = $50,000 + $500,000 = $550,000\n\nTherefore, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of service would be $550,000."}, {"role": "user", "content": "After understanding, you should act as an expert in arithmetic reasoning in English.\nLet's resolve the task you understand above step-by-step!\nFinally, you should format your answer as 'Answer: [num]'."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure, I can help you with that.

Lastly, we know that the shore was 64 seconds away from her starting point.\n\nThe question is how much water did the boat swallow by the time Julia reached the shore.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to make a few calculations. First, we need to figure out how many feet Julia rowed to reach the shore. If she was rowing at a rate of 20 feet / 16 seconds, we can calculate the distance she covered in 64 seconds:\n\n20 feet / 16 seconds = x feet / 64 seconds\n\nCross-multiplying, we find out that:\n\nx = (20 x 64) / 16 = 80 feet\n\nNow, we know that for every 10 feet, the boat swallowed 2 liters of water.

If there are now 30 already stamped letters in the stack, how many letters were in the stack when Jennie first started?\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to use our knowledge of fractions and basic arithmetic. Let's evaluate what we know:\n\n- Jennie is dealing with two stacks of letters: one that needs to be mailed with stamps, and one that already has stamps on them.\n- We know the initial size of the stack of un-stamped letters to be 60.\n- Jennie applies stamps to one-third of these letters. So how many letters is one-third of 60? \n\nTo find out, we multiply the total number of letters (60) by one-third:\n(60)(1/3) = 20 \n\nSo Jennie puts stamps on 20 of the letters, leaving the remaining 40 without a stamp. These un-stamped letters go into the stack of letters we don't know the size of yet.\n\n- Lastly, we know that there are now 30 already stamped letters in the second stack. How many letters were initially in this second stack?\n\nTo find out, we can use subtraction. If there were now 30 already stamped letters, then Jennie must have placed stamps on a total of 20 + 30 = 50 letters \n(This is because Jennie puts stamps on precisely one-third of the LETTERS, whether they're in the first or second stack.)\n\nSo, to figure out the initial number of letters in this second stack, we subtract Jennie's already-stamped letters (30) from the total letters she stamped:\n50 - 30 = 20 \n\nTherefore, we can conclude that when Jennie started there were 40 letters left in the non-stamped stack and only 20 in the already-stamped stack!\n\nAny questions, customers of hotel deKonnügenan?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "After understanding, you should act as an expert in arithmetic reasoning in English.\nLet's resolve the task you understand above step-by-step!\nFinally, you should format your answer as 'Answer: [num]'."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure, I can help with that!

We also know that Jennie has a stack of already stamped letters, and there are now 30 letters in that stack. We can use this information to figure out how many letters Jennie stamped in total: \n\n30 already stamped letters + 20 stamped by Jennie = 50 total stamped letters \n\n3. To find out how many letters were in the stack when Jennie started, we need to subtract the total number of stamped letters from the total number of letters: \n\n60 total letters - 50 stamped letters = 10 unstamped letters \n\nSo there were 10 letters in the stack of unstamped letters when Jennie started.\n\nAnswer: 10"}], "origin": {"text": "Jennie hilft im Büro ihrer Mutter.

If Brian has 20 video games, but lost 5 of them shortly before the comparison was made, how many does Bobby have?\n\nNow, we need to break down what we know. According to the problem, we know:\n\n- Bobby has 5 video games less than three times as many as Brian\n- Brian has 20 video games, but lost 5 of them shortly before the comparison was made\n\nTo figure out how many video games Bobby has, we need to use algebra to solve for the unknown variable. Let's call the number of video games Bobby has \"B\". \n\nFrom the first piece of information in the problem, we know:\n\nB = 3B - 5\n\nThis is because Bobby has 5 less than three times as many as Brian, which we know is 20 (since Brian had 20 games originally). Simplifying this equation gives:\n\n2B = 25\n\nDividing both sides by 2 gives:\n\nB = 12.5\n\nHowever, this answer doesn't make sense since you can't have half a video game! So, we have made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back to the problem and check what we missed.\n\nAh, we forgot to take into account that Brian lost 5 of his video games. So, instead of having 20 games, he only has 15.

There are only two correct options, either over 3 or less than or equal to 3. Therefore, the probability of rolling greater than 3 would be equal to (6–3) + 1 [=4,5,6 equals consecutive items].

Using the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nWe get:\n\nTime = 15 miles / 3 miles per hour = 5 hours\n\nTherefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the perimeter of the park.\n\nAnswer: 5"}], "origin": {"text": "Gary geht gerne rund um den Rand des örtlichen Parks, der ein Rechteck ist, das 1,5 Meilen auf 6 Meilen misst.

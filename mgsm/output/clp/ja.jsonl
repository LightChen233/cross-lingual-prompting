He runs for 3 days a week. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours, and on the other 2 days, he runs half the time. What is his running speed?\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\nTo find John's running speed, we need to calculate the total time he runs for during the week. \n\nOn the first day, John runs for 3 hours. On the other 2 days, he runs half the time, which means he runs for 3/2 = 1.5 hours per day. \n\nThus, John's total running time per week is 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours.\n\nNow, we can calculate John's running speed using the formula:\n\nSpeed = Distance ÷ Time\n\nWe know John runs 60 miles in a week, and he runs for 6 hours. So,\n\nSpeed = 60 miles ÷ 6 hours\n      = 10 miles per hour\n\nTherefore, John's running speed is 10 miles per hour.\n\nAnswer: 10"}], "origin": {"text": "ジョンは週に60マイル走ります。週に3日走ります。最初の日は3時間走り、その他の2日は半分走ります。彼の走る速度はどれくらいですか？", "answer": "10"}}

Firstly, we know that Mercy will receive $50,000 per year if she works for 40 years. Secondly, we know that after 20 years, she will receive a 5% annual pension. We need to know the value of her pension after 30 years of working.\n\nTo calculate Mercy's pension after 30 years, we need to first calculate how many years she will receive the $50,000 pension and how many years she will receive the 5% annual pension. As Mercy has worked for 30 years, this means that she will have worked for 20 years at the time that she can start receiving the 5% annual pension. Therefore, Mercy will receive the $50,000 pension for 20 years (from year 1 to 20) and the 5% annual pension for 10 years (from year 21 to 30).\n\nTo calculate the total value of Mercy's pension, we can use the following formula:\n\nTotal Value of Pension = Value of Pension for 20 years + Value of Pension for 10 years\n\nValue of Pension for 20 years = $50,000 x 20 years = $1,000,000\n\nValue of Pension for 10 years = Principal amount x (1 + Interest rate)^Number of years\n\n= $50,000 x (1 + 0.05)^10\n\n= $50,000 x 1.6289\n\n= $81,445\n\nTherefore, the total value of Mercy's pension after 30 years will be:\n\nTotal Value of Pension = $1,000,000 + $81,445\n\n= $1,081,445\n\nFinally, to calculate the annual value of Mercy's pension after 30 years, we just need to divide the total value of her pension by the number of years that she will receive it:\n\nAnnual Value of Pension = Total Value of Pension / Number of years\n\n= $1,081,445 / 10 years\n\n= $108,144.50 per year\n\nTherefore, if Mercy stops working after 30 years, she will receive an annual pension of $108,144.50."}, {"role": "user", "content": "After understanding, you should act as an expert in arithmetic reasoning in English.\nLet's resolve the task you understand above step-by-step!\nFinally, you should format your answer as 'Answer: [num]'."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure, I can help with that.\n\nStep 1: We know that Mercy will receive $50,000 per year if she works for 40 years.

The question is asking how many units did Harald sell in total.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to use some basic arithmetic. Since we know that Marilyn sold 10 times more than Harald, we can set up an equation where the number of units Harald sold is \"x\" and the number of units Marilyn sold is \"10x\". Their combined total is 88,000, so we can set up the equation as follows:\n\nx + 10x = 88,000\n\nSimplifying this equation, we can combine like terms:\n\n11x = 88,000\n\nSolving for x, we can divide both sides by 11:\n\nx = 8,000\n\nTherefore, Harald sold a total of 8,000 units."}, {"role": "user", "content": "After understanding, you should act as an expert in arithmetic reasoning in English.\nLet's resolve the task you understand above step-by-step!\nFinally, you should format your answer as 'Answer: [num]'."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure, here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n\n1.

This means that the remaining 160 were Chinese. We also know that there were 60 men in the Chinese team. We need to find out the number of women in the team.\n\nStep 3: Solving the problem\nTo find out the number of women in the Chinese team, we can subtract the number of men from the total number of Chinese participants. This gives us:\n\nNumber of Chinese women = Total number of Chinese - Number of Chinese men\nNumber of Chinese women = 160 - 60\nNumber of Chinese women = 100\n\nTherefore, there were 100 women in the Chinese team.\n\nStep 4: Checking our answer\nWe can check our answer by adding the number of men and women in the Chinese team and verifying that it equals the total number of Chinese participants. Let's do that:\n\nNumber of Chinese men + Number of Chinese women = 60 + 100\nNumber of Chinese men + Number of Chinese women = 160\n\nThis matches the total number of Chinese participants we calculated earlier, which means our answer is correct.\n\nAnswer: 100"}], "origin": {"text": "240人のアジア系の人のレースで、80人が日本人で残りは中国人だった。中国人チームの男子の数が60だった場合、中国人チームの女子の数は何人？", "answer": "100"}}

Therefore, the total number of straws given to hamsters can be calculated as:\n\nTotal number of straws to hamsters = 5 x 10\n\nLastly, we need to find the total number of straws given to rabbits. As per the problem statement, rabbits receive 20 straws collectively.\n\nNow, based on the problem statement, the total number of straws given to all rodents is equal to 160. Therefore, we can write the following equation:\n\nTotal number of straws to mice + Total number of straws to hamsters + Total number of straws to rabbits = 160\n\nPlugging the values we calculated earlier, we get:\n\n6 x (number of mice in each cage) x 3 + 5 x 10 + 20 = 160\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n18 x (number of mice in each cage) = 105\n\nDividing both sides by 18, we get:\n\nnumber of mice in each cage = 5.83 (rounded off)\n\nTherefore, each cage should contain 5 mice and one of them should get only 5 straws. If the rounded number is considered, it means each cage should contain 6 mice, out of which 2 will get only 5 straws.\n\nAnswer: 5 (if we consider each cage to have 5 mice) or 6 (if we consider each cage to have 6 mice)"}], "origin": {"text": "ラッセルはペットショップで働いていて、齧歯類の動物たちにわらを与えようとしている。3つのケージにそれぞれ同じ数のネズミがいて、ネズミには1匹につき6本のわらが与えられる。それとは別に、ハムスターが1匹ずつ入れられたケージが10個あり、ハムスターには1匹あたり5本のわらが与えられる。それとは別に、うさぎ小屋があり、20本のわらがうさぎ全体に与えられる。このペットショップでわらはそれ以外の用途では使われていない。齧歯類の動物たちに合計で160本のわらが与えられたとしたら、1つのケージに入っているネズミの数は何匹か？", "answer": "5"}}

Let's define some variables: \n\nLet C be the cost of one cup. \n\nLet P be the cost of one plate. \n\nWe know that: \n\n20 dozen cups = 240 cups \n\n1/2 dozen plates = 6 plates \n\nThe total cost of purchasing 6 plates is 6 * P = 6P. \n\nTherefore, the total cost of purchasing 240 cups must be 6P - $1200. \n\nWe also know that each cup costs C, so the total cost of purchasing 240 cups is 240 * C. \n\nSetting these two expressions equal to each other, we get: \n\n240C = 6P - $1200 \n\nNow we can solve for C: \n\n240C = 6P - $1200 \n\n240C + $1200 = 6P \n\n40C + $200 = P \n\nWe now know that one plate costs $40C + $200 and one cup costs C. \n\nTo find the total cost of purchasing 240 cups, we can multiply the cost of one cup by the number of cups: \n\n240C = 240 * C \n\nSo the total cost of purchasing 240 cups is 240C. \n\nPlugging in our expression for C that we found earlier, we get: \n\n240C = 240 * (40C + $200) \n\n240C = 9600C + $4800 \n\n-9360C = $4800 \n\nC = -$0.51 \n\nUh oh, something seems off! Negative prices aren't possible, so we must have made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back and check our equations. \n\nAh, I see the issue. When we set the expressions for the total cost of purchasing plates and cups equal to each other, we forgot to include the fact that the 20 dozen cups cost $6000. \n\nSo the correct equation is: \n\n240C = 6P - $4800 \n\nSolving for C, we find: \n\nC = ($6P - $4800) / 240 \n\nNow we can use this expression to find the cost of each cup, and then multiply it by 240 to get the total cost: \n\nC = ($6P - $4800) / 240 \n\nC = ($6 * (40C + $200) - $4800) / 240 \n\nC = $1.75 \n\nSo each cup costs $1.75, and the total cost of purchasing 240 cups is: \n\n240 * $1.75 = $420 \n\nTherefore, the answer is: the total cost of purchasing each cup is $420. \n\nI hope this helps!

She comes across a pair of boots that fit her budget. However, she must choose between the boots and two pairs of high heels that cost a total of five dollars less than the boots. \n\nNext, we are given information about the prices of the high heels. One pair costs 33 dollars, and the other costs twice as much. \n\nThe question we are being asked is to determine the price of the boots in dollars. \n\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the prices of the high heels in relation to the boots. We know that the total cost of both pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. \n\nLet's set up an equation to help us solve this math problem:\n\n2x + 33 = b - 5 \n\nWhere x is the cost of the cheaper pair of high heels, and b is the cost of the boots. We also know that the cost of the other pair of high heels is twice the cost of x, or 2x.\n\nWe can simplify the equation by combining like terms:\n\n2x + 33 = b - 5 \n\n2x = b - 38 \n\nNow, let's substitute 2x with its value of b-38:\n\nb - 38 + 33 = b - 5 \n\nSimplify this equation by combining like terms:\n\nb - 5 = b - 5 \n\nWe can see that the value of b, the cost of the boots, is the same on both sides of this equation. Therefore, we can conclude that the cost of the boots is 5 dollars more than the total cost of both pairs of high heels:\n\nb = 2x + 33 + 5 \n\nb = 2x + 38 \n\nWe also know that one pair of high heels costs 33 dollars, so we can substitute 33 for x:\n\nb = 2(33) + 38 \n\nb = 104 \n\nTherefore, the price of the boots in dollars is 104. \n\nEn francais: \n\nTout d'abord, la phrase décrit Gloria en train d'acheter des chaussures.

Une paire coûte 33 dollars et l'autre coûte deux fois plus cher. \n\nLa question à laquelle nous sommes confrontés est de déterminer le prix des bottines en dollars.\n\nPour résoudre ce problème mathématique, il faut tenir compte des prix des talons hauts par rapport aux bottines.

This means that her running speed is four times faster, which is 4x miles per hour.\n\nWe also know that her jumping speed is two times slower than her running speed, which is (1/2)*4x = 2x miles per hour.\n\nNow, let's calculate how much time Dana spends walking and running. Since she spends 2/3 of the time walking, she spends (2/3)*6 = 4 hours walking. Similarly, she spends 1/3 of the time running, which is (1/3)*6 = 2 hours running.\n\nNext, let's calculate how much distance she covers while walking and running.\n\nWhile walking, she covers a distance of 4*x*4 = 16x miles (since she walks for 4 hours at a speed of x miles per hour).\n\nWhile running, she covers a distance of 2*4*x = 8x miles (since she runs for 2 hours at a speed of 4x miles per hour).\n\nLastly, let's calculate how much distance she covers while jumping. She jumps at a speed of 3 miles per hour, and we know that she covers this distance for a total of 6 - (4+2) = 0 hours. Therefore, she covers a distance of 3*0 = 0 miles while jumping.\n\nThe total distance she covers is the sum of the distances she covers while walking, running, and jumping. Therefore, the total distance she covers is:\n\n16x + 8x + 0 = 24x miles\n\nWe do not have a specific value for x, so we cannot give a numerical answer.

Let's assume that Dana walks at a speed of x miles per hour.\n2. Dana runs at a speed of 4x miles per hour (since she runs four times faster than she walks).\n3. Dana jumps at a speed of (1/2)*4x = 2x miles per hour (since she jumps two times slower than she runs).\n4. Dana spends 2/3 of the time walking, which is (2/3)*6 = 4 hours.\n5. Dana spends 1/3 of the time running, which is (1/3)*6 = 2 hours.\n6. Dana covers a distance of 4x*4 = 16x miles while walking (since she walks for 4 hours at a speed of x miles per hour).\n7.

We need to find the value of x to calculate the total distance.\n11. We know that Dana spends a total of 6 hours traveling, so we can set up the equation: 4x*4 + 2*4x + 3*0 = d, where d is the total distance she covers.\n12. Simplifying the equation, we get: 16x + 8x = d.\n13. Combining like terms, we get: 24x = d.\n14. We can substitute the value of x into the equation to get the total distance: d = 24x = 24*(3/4) = 18.\n15.

The third friend presses the doorbell ten times more than the fourth friend, who pressed it 60 times. \n\nTo find the total number of times the doorbell rang, we can use basic math and arithmetic operations. Let x be the number of times the first friend pressed the doorbell. Then, the second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 more times, which is equivalent to 1/4x additional presses.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of hours of consultations per day. To do this, we multiply the number of patients per day (500) by the average examination time per patient in hours (0.4).

The doctors charge $150 per hour, so for 200 hours of consultations, the total charge is:\n\n200 x $150 = $30,000\n\nSo the hospital pays $30,000 per day to the doctors for consultations.\n\n4. Next, we can calculate the total amount charged by the hospital to patients per day. The hospital charges $200 per hour, so for 200 hours of consultations, the total charge is:\n\n200 x $200 = $40,000\n\nSo the hospital earns $40,000 per day from patient consultations.\n\n5.

The task is to determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months if it initially costs $20 and its price increases by 20% every two months. To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps and use some basic mathematical operations.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the price increase after each two months. We know that the price of the bag increases by 20% every two months. That means the new price is 1.2 times the previous price. Therefore, after the first two months, the price of the bag will be 20 * 1.2 = $24.

Let's assume that Fred delivered y red roses instead of the 16x that Sandra ordered. \n\nThe ratio of delivered red roses to the ordered quantity of 16x is y/16x. \n\nStep 3: Set up an equation to solve for the missing quantity of red roses\nThe task specifies that Sandra ordered 4 times more red roses than white carnations, which means that she ordered 4/5 times fewer white carnations than the number of calla lilies she ordered (because the ratio of calla lilies to white carnations is 5:1). \n\nSince Sandra ordered 200 calla lilies, she must have ordered 4/5 * 200 = 160 white carnations. \n\nWe know that Sandra's total order was incomplete, but we only want to know the quantity of red roses that were missing. Therefore, we can set up an equation that relates the missing quantity of red roses to the quantity of white carnations that were delivered: \n\n16x - y = 4/5 * 160\nMultiplying both sides by 5/4, we get: \n20x - 5y = 200\n\nStep 4: Solve the equation for the missing quantity of red roses\nWe don't know the value of x or y, but we have two equations that relate them: \ny/16x = delivered ratio \n20x - 5y = 200 \n\nWe can use substitution to solve for y in terms of x: \ny = (16x * delivered ratio) \nSubstitute into the second equation: \n20x - 5(16x * delivered ratio) = 200 \n20x - 80x * delivered ratio = 200 \nSimplify: \nx = 2 / (8 * delivered ratio - 1)\n\nStep 5: Calculate the minimum amount of red roses required for complete delivery\nWe know that Sandra is demanding the missing red roses to be delivered before 5 PM, so Fred must deliver at least 16x - y red roses before that time. \n\nSince we don't know the exact value of y, we need to determine the minimum possible value of delivered ratio that would still satisfy Sandra's demand. \n\nTo do that, we know that Fred must deliver enough red roses to make up for the missing quantity: \n\n16x - y >= 16x - (16x * delivered ratio) \n16x - y >= 16x(1 - delivered ratio) \ny <= 16x(delivered ratio) \n\nTherefore, the minimum value of delivered ratio that would satisfy Sandra's demand is: \n\n16x - (16x * delivered ratio) = number of missing red roses \nnumber of missing red roses >= 16x(1 - delivered ratio) \n\nSolving for delivered ratio: \n16x(1 - delivered ratio) >= number of missing red roses \n1 - delivered ratio >= number of missing red roses / 16x \ndelivered ratio <= 1 - number of missing red roses / 16x \n\nSubstituting x = 2 / (8 * delivered ratio - 1) from our previous calculation: \ndelivered ratio <= 1 - number of missing red roses / (16 * (2 / (8 * delivered ratio - 1)))\nsimplifying: \ndelivered ratio <= (8 - number of missing red roses / (8 * delivered ratio - 1))\n\nNow, we need to find the minimum value of delivered ratio that would still satisfy Sandra's demand, so we need to set the number of missing red roses equal to zero and solve: \n\n8 - 0 / (8 * delivered ratio - 1) \n8 / (8 * delivered ratio - 1) \n1 / (delivered ratio - 1/8) \n\nTherefore, to satisfy Sandra's demand and keep her as a customer, Fred needs to deliver at least: \n\n16x - y >= 16x(1 - 1/8) \n16x - y >= 14x \ny <= 2x \n\nUsing our calculation for x: \nx = 2 / (8 * delivered ratio - 1) \n\nWe can calculate the minimum amount of delivered ratio to satisfy Sandra's demand: \n\n2x = 4 / (8 * delivered ratio - 1) \n8 * delivered ratio - 1 = 4 / (2x) \n8 * delivered ratio = 4 / (2x) + 1 \ndelivered ratio = (4 / (2x) + 1) / 8 \n\nPlugging in our previous value for x: \ndelivered ratio = (4 / (2 * (2 / (8 * delivered ratio - 1))) + 1) / 8 \n\nSimplifying this expression gives: \ndelivered ratio = 11/12 \n\nTherefore, to satisfy Sandra's demand, Fred needs to deliver a minimum of: \n\n16x - y >= 14x \n2x <= y \n\nUsing our previous calculation for x: \nx = 2 / (8 * delivered ratio - 1) \nx = 2 / (8 * 11/12 - 1) \nx = 16 \n\nTherefore, the minimum amount of red roses that Fred needs to deliver to satisfy Sandra's demand is: \n\n16x - y = 16 * 16 - 2x = 254 \n\nAnswer: 254"}], "origin": {"text": "Sandra, la fleuriste du coin, est très mécontente de la livraison incomplète effectuée par Fred.

Her lowest average is 71, so we subtract that from her current average: \n\n87.6 - 71 = 16.6\n\nNow we can plug in the values we have: \n\n(16.6 + x) ÷ 6 = 93\n\nWe want to solve for x, which represents the grade Brinley needs to get on her sixth test. We can start by multiplying both sides of the equation by 6: \n\n16.6 + x = 558\n\nThen we can subtract 16.6 from both sides: \n\nx = 541.4\n\nSo Brinley needs to get a grade of 541.4 on her sixth test to achieve an overall average of 93.

We need to calculate how much money Janeth will have left by the end of the 12 months.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can start by calculating the total amount Janeth will pay back. The additional 10% of $2,000 is $200 (10% of 2,000). So, the total amount Janeth has to pay back is $2,200.\n\nNext, we can calculate the total amount Janeth will pay back over 12 months. Janeth is paying $165 per month for 12 months. So, the total amount she will pay back over 12 months is $1,980 ($165 x 12).\n\nTo find out how much money Janeth will have left by the end of 12 months, we need to subtract the total amount she will pay back ($1,980) from the total amount she borrowed plus the additional 10% ($2,200). \n\nTherefore, the amount of money that will remain with Janeth after paying the loan is $220 ($2,200 - $1,980). \n\nEn français: \n\nTout d'abord, comprenons l'énoncé du problème.

Le supplément de 10 % de 2 000 $ est de 200 $ (10 % de 2 000). Le montant total que Janeth devra donc rembourser est de 2 200 $.\n\nEnsuite, nous pouvons calculer le montant total que Janeth remboursera sur 12 mois. Janeth paie 165 $ par mois pendant 12 mois. Par conséquent, le montant total qu'elle remboursera sur 12 mois est de 1 980 $ (165 x 12).\n\nPour déterminer combien d'argent il restera à Janeth à la fin des 12 mois, nous devons soustraire le montant total qu'elle remboursera (1 980 $) du montant total qu'elle a emprunté plus le supplément de 10 % (2 200 $).\n\nPar conséquent, le montant d'argent qui restera à Janeth après avoir remboursé le prêt est de 220 $ (2 200 $ - 1 980 $)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "After understanding, you should act as an expert in arithmetic reasoning in English.\nLet's resolve the task you understand above step-by-step!\nFinally, you should format your answer as 'Answer: [num]'."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure, I can solve the task. \n\nJaneth borrowed $2,000 and promised to pay back with an additional 10% of the amount, which is $200.
